This is a test file for Bobbin. For more info, go to https://github.com/radiatoryang/bobbin


To use Bobbin to import a Google Doc as a Text Asset in your Unity project, you need to:


1. Create a Google Doc


2. Click the “Share” button in the upper-right corner of the Google Docs screen
  

3. Click “Get shareable link” in the upper-right of the share dialog
  

4. Copy the share link (or click “Copy link”)
(NOTE: if link sharing is already on, then you could also copy the URL from your browser’s address bar too.)
  

5. In the Unity menu bar, click Bobbin > Add URLs and Settings
  

6. In the BobbinSettings in the Unity inspector, click “Add New File”
  

7. Paste the link from Step 4 into the URL textbox
  

8. Click “Save As…” button and pick somewhere to save it in your Project folder


9. (Bobbin can now automatically refresh and download your file)


Some important notes to keep in mind:
* Images (and anything else that isn’t text) won’t be imported into the Unity text asset.
* Bobbin is one-way only, you can’t use it to edit the Google Doc from the Unity Editor.


But still, there’s so much you can do now -- for example, you could collaborate with writers or translators via Google Docs, and then Bobbin can download the files automatically into your project.
